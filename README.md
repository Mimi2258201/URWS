URWS is a modular system for handling ranged weapons and guns in Unity projects. It maintains a broad range of use cases, while keeping modular enough to allow it to be shaped appropriately to any project's needs. It is not a First Person Shooter template. While it does include some assets and examples that work out the gate, most art assets are entirely demonstrational. The focus is function, not plug and play. It is unlikely you will need to modify the orignal code for most projects, but you likely have to use some of the events and parameters provided by the asset to extend the functionality of the asset to your needs.
